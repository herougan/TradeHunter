Separate logic into the different util files

DataRetrievalUtil downloads data from many files into static. What it downloads is based on a text file.
DataTestingUtil tests based on data retrieved. Text File is used as reference (or just use every file in folder)

Objective:

1) Fix testing

2) Finish Optimisation

3) Adjust FMACDRobot

4) Progress windows in front, QTUpdate(), share axes

Main Features:

1) Optimise robots against dataset(s) producing recommended initial variables (iVars)
- single type testing vs multi type

2) During sim plotting, only plot the latest data, do not clear and replot the xlim'd graph. Actually current way may be better,
as old data is cleared

3) One-time plot, simulate a test and do a one-time plot of all the data.

4) Main methods for non-GUI treatments. e.g. for interactability etc.

# Algorithms

New.

# Final

6) Run robot

7) Run robot controller (Manages several robots)

8) Shapesetdef contains data specific to certain chart profiles. One can test their robot against these chart profiles
to see which type of trends/shapes/market conditions it is better at trading in.









10) Lag Signals
