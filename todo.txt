DataRetrievalUtil downloads data from many files into static. What it downloads is based on a text file.
DataTestingUtil tests based on data retrieved. Text File is used as reference (or just use every file in folder)

                                Short, 10 (lots), False, False (True, True for both), Start, End
2) DRU downloads data into static from options txt file

3) Copy-and-pasted files contingency: When updating datasets/re-downloading data, if file does not exit,
