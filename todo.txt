Separate logic into the different util files

DataRetrievalUtil downloads data from many files into static. What it downloads is based on a text file.
DataTestingUtil tests based on data retrieved. Text File is used as reference (or just use every file in folder)

Bug fixes:

1) Dataset data auto fill in does not fill in past the first. Should.

2) Rename ivar, delete ivar

3) Rename dataset, delete dataset

4) Delete all data button

5) Bring progress windows to the front
5b) Testing and optimisation: Progress bar embedded
5c) Graph embedded during optimisation
5d) result analysis shows all datasets tested

6) Load optimisation page later


Objective:

1) Fix testing

2) Finish Optimisation

3) Adjust FMACDRobot

4) Progress windows in front, QTUpdate(), share axes

Main Features:

1) Optimise robots against dataset(s) producing recommended initial variables (iVars)
- single type testing vs multi type

2) During sim plotting, only plot the latest data, do not clear and replot the xlim'd graph. Actually current way may be better,
as old data is cleared

3) One-time plot, simulate a test and do a one-time plot of all the data.

4) Main methods for non-GUI treatments. e.g. for interactability etc.

# Algorithms

New.

# Final

6) Run robot

7) Run robot controller (Manages several robots)

8) Shapesetdef contains data specific to certain chart profiles. One can test their robot against these chart profiles
to see which type of trends/shapes/market conditions it is better at trading in.






UI:

1) Switching between datasets resets the current datatable scroll value

2) Dataset suggested fill issues

Others:


10) Lag Signals
