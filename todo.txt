Separate logic into the different util files

DataRetrievalUtil downloads data from many files into static. What it downloads is based on a text file.
DataTestingUtil tests based on data retrieved. Text File is used as reference (or just use every file in folder)


1) Store signals as DataFrame - Type, Vol, SMA-Fail, MACD-Fail, Start, End
                                Short, 10 (lots), False, False (True, True for both), Start, End
2) DRU downloads data into static from options txt file

3) Copy-and-pasted files contingency: When updating datasets/re-downloading data, if file does not exit,
try download again (once), continue.

4) All filenames to have '__' between variables



Main Features:

1) Result Analysis page, default page
1a) Progress bar not be in another window

3) Optimise robots against dataset(s) producing recommended initial variables (iVars)
- single type testing vs multi type

4) Test + Plot robot against 1 data instrument, producing 'white-box' plots

5) Analysis for dataset

# Final

6) Run robot

7) Run robot controller (Manages several robots)

8) Shapesetdef contains data specific to certain chart profiles. One can test their robot against these chart profiles
to see which type of trends/shapes/market conditions it is better at trading in.









10) Lag Signals
